### General Notes

Since v1.0, DBpedia Spotlight was split into two versions, under the same API,  as follow:

  - DBpedia-Spotlight-Model: described in [Improving Efficiency and Accuracy in Multilingual Entity Extraction](http://jodaiber.de/doc/entity.pdf)

  - DBpedia-Spotlight-Lucene: described in [DBpedia Spotlight: Shedding Light on the Web of Documents](http://www.dbpedia-spotlight.org/docs/spotlight.pdf)

This important movement was the way that we found to deliver faster fixes and new releases, providing solutions for each annotation approach.

Our first achievement is related with licensing. DBpedia Spotlight Model is now full compliance with Apache 2.0. It means that you can use it without any commercial restrictions.

We are so excited because there's even more great news to come.

If you require any further information, feel free to contact us via dbpedia@infai.org. We are already very excited to spend time with you on further community meetings and to publish new DBpedia releases.

Keep annotating,

All the best


#### Shedding Light on the Web of Documents

DBpedia Spotlight looks for ~3.5M things of unknown or ~320 known types in text and tries to link them to their global unique identifiers in [DBpedia](http://dbpedia.org).

#### Demonstration

Go to our [Demonstration](http://dbpedia-spotlight.github.io/demo/) page, copy+paste some text and play with the parameters to see how it works.
